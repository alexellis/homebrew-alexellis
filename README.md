# homebrew-alexellis

A homebrew tap for MacOS users for arkade, k3sup and run-job.

## You may prefer arkade ðŸ™Œ

arkade is a multi-arch marketplace for developers, which downloads binaries directly from GitHub, without the latency you find with brew. No access token is required.

It works on ARM, regular PCs, servers, in CI and on Macs, including M1

## Limitations

Support is only given for MacOS, if you're a Linux user, please raise an issue and request support to be added, or send a pull request.
